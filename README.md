## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Fast Protocol
This is a version of the [FAST protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/264.pdf), built as a Next.js application. This was originally built based on python running in a terminal.

The application works as a decentralized p2p application, where nodes connected to the auction run the auctioning protocol, such that an auctioneer isn't necessary.

It's build on top of the gun.js decentralized graph library.

**Building blocks**:
- [ ] P2P network with functioning messaging
- [ ] Gun.js
- [ ] Elliptic curves
- [ ] PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
- [ ] Metamask
- [ ] Veto protocol
  - [ ] NIZK (Non-interactive Zero Knowledge)

## Notes

This example shows how to integrate the TypeScript type system into Next.js. Since TypeScript is supported out of the box with Next.js, all we have to do is to install TypeScript.

```
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

To enable TypeScript's features, we install the type declarations for React and Node.

```
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

When we run `next dev` the next time, Next.js will start looking for any `.ts` or `.tsx` files in our project and builds it. It even automatically creates a `tsconfig.json` file for our project with the recommended settings.

Next.js has built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for Next.js' modules straight away.

A `type-check` script is also added to `package.json`, which runs TypeScript's `tsc` CLI in `noEmit` mode to run type-checking separately. You can then include this, for example, in your `test` scripts.
